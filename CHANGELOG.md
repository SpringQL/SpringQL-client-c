# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog][Keep a Changelog] and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning][Semantic Versioning].

We originally added `### For developers` sections in order to separate changes for end-users and developers.
All other sections are for end-users.

The CHANGELOG mainly includes changes only applied to the C client.
Also check the changes in springql-core: <https://github.com/SpringQL/SpringQL/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md>.
